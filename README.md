# What's goin on

Created using React, Next, and Express, this website streamlines the process of showing the Skyline High School Robotics team members valuable data.

## Features

After signing in through Discord Oauth, the client will side-check the hour database, and if there is a user match then you are signed in! Identifiable data, such as Discord ID is saved in a session allowing for refreshes without needing to sign in again. 

Once signed in, users can see their total amount of hours, the last meeting they attended, upcoming competition, and even a leaderboard of top hours to see where the member stacks up.
